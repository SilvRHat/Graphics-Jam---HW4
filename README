Homework 4 - Projections
Computer Graphics
Gavin Zimmerman


ABOUT
This project explores camera projections and camera movement for first person.
Each view may be changed via the camera controls - however the last one simulates a character constrained to walking along a plane so the user cannot move upwards/downwards in mode 3.


COMPILING
To build/ compile the program simply run 'make' on command line.
And to run, run './hw4'


CONTROLS
    'm'                     change camera mode
    'q'                     Exit the program

    MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON     Rotate Camera
    'w'                     Move forward
    's'                     Move backward
    'a'                     Move left
    'd'                     Move right
    SHIFT                   Move faster



TIME TAKEN
~6 hours

The majority of time taken was building the scene (~3 hours). An additional 2 hours was spent on modifying my camera script from last week already suitable for movement and rotation by mouse.
